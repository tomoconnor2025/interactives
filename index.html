      There has been a 7.5% fall in traffic in Manhattanâ€™s central business district since the implementation of a congestion fee in New York City on Jan. 5, according to
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25lj1nek5o">BBC News</a>.
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The fee was introduced to ease traffic and generate funds for investment in public transit infrastructure in the city.
      <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/traffic-falls-new-york-city-after-9-congestion-fee-introduced-2025-01-13/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20Jan%2013%20(Reuters),transit%20officials%20said%20on%20Monday.">Reuters</a>
      reported that New York City transit officials estimate the fee will generate $500 million in its first year.
